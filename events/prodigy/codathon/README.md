# Codathon 13.0

Codathon 13.0 is a problem-solving-centric programming event under the **Prodigy** series at **Vortex 13.0**, ICT Mumbai.  
The event is designed to re-center programming around its original purpose: **thinking clearly, modeling carefully, and solving problems computationally**.

Rather than emphasizing speed, tool familiarity, or competitive pressure, Codathon focuses on how participants **reason**, **structure ideas**, and **translate understanding into code**.

## Philosophy & Intent

At its core, Codathon is a response to a growing disconnect between *writing code* and *thinking computationally*.  
Modern tooling has made implementation easier than ever - but true problem solving still requires patience, logic, abstraction, and deliberate decision-making.

Codathon aims to revive that discipline.

Participants are encouraged to:

- Engage deeply with the problem before writing code  
- Treat programming as a medium for reasoning, not just execution  
- Balance correctness, clarity, and efficiency  
- Make their assumptions, choices, and trade-offs explicit  

The event values **how a solution is built** as much as **what the solution produces**.

---

## Nature of the Problems

Problems in Codathon are designed to:

- Be approachable, yet non-trivial  
- Require logical structuring rather than pattern matching  
- Encourage simplification, prioritization, and modeling  
- Reward clarity of thought and algorithmic discipline  

The progression of the event moves from lighter logical challenges toward deeper, more involved tasks that test how participants navigate complexity over time.

The intent is not to filter participants aggressively, but to give every solver the opportunity to experience the **joy of genuine problem solving**.

## What Codathon Tries to Observe

Codathon is interested in observing:

- How a problem is framed before it is solved  
- How an approach evolves under constraints  
- How engineering intuition is translated into algorithms  
- How clarity, structure, and reasoning are reflected in code  

Evaluation exists, but learning and self-assessment remain central.  
The real outcome is not a rank, but a sharper sense of one’s own problem-solving ability.

## Round Structure & Environment
### Round 1: Foundations of Computational Thinking


Round 1 was conducted in a controlled computer-lab.\
The round was intentionally designed to be doable yet revealing - rewarding clarity, not speed.

### Round 2 and Beyond  Depth & Application

As the event progressed, problems evolved toward:

- deeper modeling requirements

- constrained decision-making

- algorithmic trade-offs under limited information

The progression tested how participants navigate complexity over time, not just how they perform under pressure.

Their collective effort has gone into curating problems that respect participants’ time, challenge their thinking, and preserve the integrity of the problem-solving process.

## Closing Note

Codathon 13.0 is not about proving how fast you can code,  
but about rediscovering why you code in the first place.

Clear thought. Honest effort. Meaningful problems.
